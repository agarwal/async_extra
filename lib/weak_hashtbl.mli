(** A [Weak_hashtbl.t] is a hashtable that will drop a key and value if the value is no
    longer referenced (by any non-weak pointers).  [Weak_hashtbl] is in Async rather than
    Core because it relies on finalization in its implementation.  Using non-Async
    finalizers in an async program is wrong (see Async_gc.mli for details), and having
    [Weak_hashtbl] in Async prevents users from making this mistake.  Unlike (OCaml's)
    [Weak.Make], which also describes itself as a "weak hashtable," [Weak_hashtbl] gives a
    dictionary style structure.  In fact, OCaml's Weak.Make may better be described as a
    weak set.

    There's a tricky type of bug one can write with this module, e.g.:

    {[
      type t =
        { foo : string
        ; bar : float Incr.t
        }

      let tbl = Weak_hashtbl.create ()
      let x1 =
        let t = Weak_hashtbl.find_or_add tbl key ~default:(fun () ->
          (... some function that computes a t...))
        in
        t.bar
    ]}

    At this point, the value associated with [key] is unreachable (since all we did with it
    was project out field bar), so it may disappear from the table at any time. *)
